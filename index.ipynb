    "A common use for lists is to group together each element of a set or subset. Usually there will be times where we will want to have direct access to a group of elements and be able to query or change each of the elements. For instance, we have a list of people (our group of 'elements') who are all going to the same housewarming party. Each person has an RSVP status attribute. To check each person's status, we will need to iterate through each element and access their status.\n",

    "housewarming_invitees = [{'name': \"Jen\", 'rsvp': \"Yes\"}, {'name': \"Mike\", 'rsvp': \"No\"}, {'name': \"Henry\", 'rsvp': \"Yes\"}, {'name': \"Anna\", 'rsvp': \"No\"}]\n",
    "for invitee in housewarming_invitees:\n",
    "    print(invitee['rsvp'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, we can query each element, but let's say we need to send a list of the guest's names to a company that is going to make seating cards with each guests' name? We don't want to re-write all the names, but we don't want to just iterate through and blindly send over a list of names without making sure that they are all capitalized properly. So, We need to iterate through each element and titlize each person's name.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "housewarming_invitees = [{'name': \"Jen\", 'rsvp': \"Yes\"}, {'name': \"Mike\", 'rsvp': \"No\"}, {'name': \"Henry\", 'rsvp': \"Yes\"}, {'name': \"Anna\", 'rsvp': \"No\"}]\n",

    "In this lab, we practiced iterating on lists. We looked at how to break down the logic for each step of the operation and what questions we would like to solve for using iterators and lists. We looked at lists that contained elements of different data types. We also wrote our own functions to immitate some already built-in list methods as well as some functions that perform commonly used operations.\n",
